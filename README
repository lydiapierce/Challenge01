Challenge 01: Looping, Conditionals, Modules
============================================

Introduction
------------
This challenge combines all the ideas you've learned up until now to do a little directory management. Do the LPTHW exercises, and use the remaining listed resources to help you finish the task.

Description
-----------
Included in the exercise is a zipfile, 'files.zip'. It contains 200 files with random character strings for names, all lowercase. First, unzip this file into a directory named 'original_files'.

Your job is to write a program, ex1.py, that does the following things:

1. Create 26 directories in the current directory, one for each letter of the alphabet:
    ./a/
    ./b/
    ./c/
    etc.

2. Loop through all the files in the original_files directory, and organize each of those files into the directory that their name starts with.

### Example:
    The file named 'artichoke.txt' would go into the directory './a/',
    'bartholomew.txt' would go into './b/'.

Here is a very rough outline of the task components:
* Figure out how to determine a listing of files in a directory (and what format that list is in)
* Figure out how to move a file from one directory to another
* Iterate through your listing of files and determine what the appropriate target directory is
